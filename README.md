### About Me

I build user-facing applications with React and TypeScript. Currently contracting at Yahoo! Sports (brought back for second engagement), shipping components for millions of users across NFL, NBA, MLB, Tennis, and Golf platforms.

I like solving the full spectrum of frontend challenges - component architecture, performance optimization, and making interfaces that actually work well.

**Currently seeking:** Full-time frontend or fullstack role with a strong team working on meaningful projects.
